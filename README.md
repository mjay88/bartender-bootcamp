# Unit 01: Bartender Training web application using React

## Overview

I am building a bartender “boot camp” web app for my Portfolio Project using React. The app's goal is to help the user become familiar with the skills and techniques needed to work in a modern high-end bar successfully.

 My goal for the app is to familiarize myself with beginner and some advanced React skills and concepts that I will need to demonstrate to a potential employer, so they know, that upon being hired, I will be able to contribute to a development team with as little guidance as possible. 

## Key React Concepts Covered

The following react concepts will be demonstrated in this project.

Navigation using react-router-dom
Proper state management using Redux
JSX, conditional rendering using JSX
Using react hooks
Creating custom hooks
Component Composition
Implementing styling using React Bootstrap and custom css + scss files

## Key JavaScript Concepts Covered

The following JavaScript concepts will be demonstrated in this project.

Functional Programming
Optional Chaining
Null Coalescing 
Destructuring
Deployment
Using Express and Mongodb for the backend


## Key Features of the app

The ability to track the user's progress through the app
A testing component to test the user's knowledge
Sidebar navigation and footer “pagination” navigation

## Minimum Via Product Plan
I hope to have the site fully navigable with all of the routing hooked up for all sections and to have the multiple choice testing feature completed. If I have time I will start the user building out the authentication/login page, but this is mostly the backend so I will try to focus on front-end functionality for this course. I also hope to have the styling at least 80% complete.

## Future features to be added in the future

Integrate mongo db for user data
Custom login/register component using bcrypt 
Search feature to query any document from data base based on key word


## Projected Areas of Concern

Integrating backend functionality
Deciding on data model for course content
Technology for storing images, thinking about using Cloudinary
Platform for deploying site
