					"The spirit's popularity surged in England in the 18th century, leading to the infamous Gin Craze. The British government eventually imposed regulations to curb gin consumption, leading to the development of more refined and high-quality gin varieties.",
					"The invention of the continuous still in the 19th century by Aeneas Coffey revolutionized gin production, making it easier to produce a cleaner and purer spirit. This technological advancement paved the way for the creation of the London Dry style, one of the most popular gin types today.",
					"Gin played a significant role in British colonial history, with the Gin and Tonic becoming a staple drink in the tropics, thanks to its mix with quinine to ward off malaria. Today, gin is celebrated for its versatility and is a key ingredient in many classic cocktails.",

In pot distillation, botanicals are soaked in the spirit before distillation; in vapor infusion, botanicals are placed in a basket through which the spirit vapor passes.",
					"After distillation, the gin is diluted with water to the desired strength, usually between 37.5% and 50% alcohol by volume. Some gins are aged in barrels to add complexity, though most are bottled and sold clear.",
